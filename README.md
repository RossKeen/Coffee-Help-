# Coffee, Help!

A simple and universally relatable app for coffee/tea lovers. Coffee, Help! allows the user to track their daily caffeiene intake with the touch of a button. It has responsive visual representations of data cahnges that can be seen at a glance.

It is easy to personalise, with user inputs to change your daily caffeine goal, add your own favourite custom drink, pick and change your favourite daily drinks to be displayed on the home screen as a quick add option. We have designed this to be interactive with the user, and can be reflected in our mascot Derek Mcbeans.
