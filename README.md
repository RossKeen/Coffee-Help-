# Coffee, Help!

A simple and universally relatable app for coffee/tea lovers. Coffee, Help! allows the user to track their daily caffeine intake with the touch of a button. It has responsive visual representations of data changes that can be seen at a glance.

It is easy to personalise, with user inputs to change your daily caffeine goal, add your own favourite custom drink, pick and change your favourite daily drinks to be displayed on the home screen as a quick-add option. We have designed this to be interactive with the user, and your changes can be reflected in the behaviour of our mascot Derek McBeans.

A video demonstration of the app is available at https://youtu.be/jF7IJb47cdM
